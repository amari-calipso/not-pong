# Pong++
Pong++ -  A game inspired by https://www.lessmilk.com/almost-pong/

to run, open or compile `PongPlusPlus.opal` using the opal compiler.

to jump, you can press space, enter, w, the up arrow, or you can click on the window;
to sprint, you can press c, z, the left and right arrows, or you can right-click on the window.

if the game is running at a low framerate, you can disable raycasting by setting the `RAYCASTING` variable to `False`, 
or lower the amount of rays casted, by changing the `RAYS_QTY` variable (360 by default).
