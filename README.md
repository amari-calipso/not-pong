# Pong++
Pong++ -  A game inspired by https://www.lessmilk.com/almost-pong/

to run, open or compile `PongPlusPlus.opal` using the opal compiler.

to jump, you can press space, enter, w, the up arrow, or you can click on the window;
to sprint, you can press c, z, the left and right arrows, or you can right-click on the window.

if the game is running at a low framerate, you can disable raycasting by setting the `raycasting` field of settings.json to `false`, 
or increase the number of frames in which the light is not updated, by changing the `update-each` field (1 by default).
